# Analysis of Customer Behavior in E-Commerce: Mobile App vs Website

# Project Description

This project aims to analyze customer behavior to determine whether an e-commerce company should prioritize improving its mobile app or its desktop website to maximize customer spending. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we explore the relationships between customer activities, such as time spent on various platforms, and their yearly spending.

# Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

Avg. Session Length: Average duration of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time customers spend using the mobile app (in minutes).
Time on Website: Average time customers spend on the website (in minutes).
Length of Membership: Number of years the customer has been a member.
Yearly Amount Spent: Total amount spent by customers annually (target variable).
Objective
To identify the key factors influencing the Yearly Amount Spent and provide actionable insights to help the company decide whether to focus its efforts on improving the mobile app or desktop website.

# Tools and Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To uncover patterns and trends in the data.
Data Visualization: To better understand the relationships between variables.
Statistical Analysis and Modeling: To determine the significance and influence of each feature on the target variable.
Machine Learning: To predict yearly spending based on customer behavior and generate insights.

# Conclusion

The analysis yielded the following key findings:

The Length of Membership is the most significant factor influencing yearly spending.
While the Time on App shows a meaningful relationship with yearly spending, the Time on Website has little to no impact.
Customers are more influenced by mobile applications than by desktop websites for online shopping.

# Interpretations

The company should prioritize improving the mobile app experience to drive higher spending among customers.
The desktop website requires significant optimization to better engage users and encourage purchases.
Efforts to enhance customer retention (increasing membership length) could also result in increased yearly spending.
